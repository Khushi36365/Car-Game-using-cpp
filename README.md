# Car Game Simulation using C++

This is a simple text-based car game built with C++. The program allows users to control a car using commands entered in the terminal. It's an interactive exercise to demonstrate conditional statements, loops, and user input handling in C++.


## Features

- **Start the Car**: Command `start` to start the car.
- **Stop the Car**: Command `stop` to stop the car.
- **Get Help**: Command `help` to display the list of available commands.
- **Exit the Game**: Command `quit` to terminate the program.
- Handles repeated commands gracefully (e.g., trying to start an already started car or stop an already stopped car).
- Displays an error message for unrecognized commands.
